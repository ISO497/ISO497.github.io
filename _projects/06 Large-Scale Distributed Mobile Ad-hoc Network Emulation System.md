This project constructed a communication **emulation** system deployed in a **distributed** framework and managed by Kubernetes. The system utilized Docker to create containers as independent nodes and emulated the effect of physical layer and data link layer through its highly flexible model plugin. 

* Emulated Link 16 data link by TDMA model and calculated the BER-SINR curve in matlab as the input to the TDMA model as the judge of accepting a signal or not. 
* Took the tracks of UAV swarm generated by path planning algorithms dynamically as input and emulated the communication of UAV swarm in the scenarios with obstacles.
* Deployed data compression and depression algorithm at the application layer to realize efficient data transmission in the emulation system.
