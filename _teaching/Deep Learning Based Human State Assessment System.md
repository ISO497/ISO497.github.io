This project construct a **non-contact human state assessment** system to monitor the realtime state of drivers and alert when abnormal state is predicted through videos captured by only one or two cameras. This system including target detection, keypoint detection, head pose estimation and time series prediction algorithms.

* Participated in the survey, design, implementation and testing of developing the system.
